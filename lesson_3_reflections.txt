When would you want to create a new repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Personally, I think creating a new repo is essential when substantial changes are to be made 
on the file one is currently working on.

Why might you always want to pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically
staying up-to-date with your remote repository?

Hmmmm, I guess having a version of my work saved locally is of great importance. One 
might not always have reception (internet conncectivity)...
