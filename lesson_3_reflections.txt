When would you want to create a new repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Personally, I think creating a new repo is essential when substantial changes are to be made 
on the file one is currently working on.

Why might you always want to pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically
staying up-to-date with your remote repository?

Hmmmm, I guess having a version of my work saved locally is of great importance. One 
might not always have reception (internet conncectivity)... 

Describe the difference between forks, clones and branches. When would you use one instead
of another?

Forks and clones are almost similar. Forks are copies of a repo made on github while clones
copies of a repo made locally. On the other hand, branches are offsets/ideas that are
established within a repository. These 3 concepts have different use cases. For example, 
forks are used when reference/link to the original repo is required, while clones are used 
when no reference is needed whereas Branches are used when a project has multiple features
or collaborators.
